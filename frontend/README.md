This project was bootstrapped with [CRNA](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

##Requirements

You must have npm version 4+ and NodeJS version 6+ installed in your system.

Install CRNA and [NativeBase](https://docs.nativebase.io/docs/GetStarted.html) for projects created with CRNA.

Download and install the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en) in your android device for instant previewing with hot reload supported.

Optional(For now):

Set up Android SDK and AVD as mentioned in the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRLLjlpy0r4) is a great video tutorial on the same by Traversy Media on YouTube.
