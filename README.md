# Stuff


## Ground rules on github.

* Two people shouldn't work on the same file. Keep your work seperate and collaborate to avoid confusion.

* Always do a Pull request to add anything from a line of code to a feature.

* Don't push directly to the repository, always push to your own fork first and from there do a Pull request to the main repo.

* Write meaningful commit messages.

* Keep the frontend and backend in code separated.

* The master is always stable, you don't have access to edit the master branch directly.

* Don't work on master branch, whatever you're doing, make a feature branch, the master branch should always be stable.

### Violation of the ground rules are punishable by death.
